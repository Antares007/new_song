What is the problem?
Parsing text from left to right char by char to identify stuctured costructs is not a trivial task.
Parsing from right to left is a simpler task because we already have seen the whole sentence.
Communication in distributed systems is defined as message passing.
HTTP is a too complex protocol. Parsing HTTP incrementally is not a trivial thing and this overhead job requires electricity and makes unnecessary heat (global warming).
We don't use a universal communication protocol which is the word.

Why is it worth solving?
It will simplify, speed up communication and save electricity around the world.

How did you solve it?
we need to open our eyes to the protocol which already exists, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God"
whole our reality we can describe by words and sentences.

What alternatives did you have?
HTTP/JSON API's accidental complexity.

What evidence did you have that it works?
Reference implementation.
